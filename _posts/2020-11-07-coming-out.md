The first person I came out to was Eisa. My junior year of college I was an RA in a freshman dorm on Stanford's campus; Eisa was one of my co-staff. I remember sitting with them on a futon in my tiny room, staring up at twinkly lights hung beside long rows of photos on the wall---held by clothespins on twine.

I remember the immense difficulty of saying those words, expressing to another person this excitement and fear long confined to my own mind: "I'm queer". Since that moment, about four years ago, those words haven't gotten much easier to say.

One of the first things Eisa asked me in that conversation was to tell them about my first gay crush. With their question, I was instantly back in my Catholic parochial middle school. Every boy in the class was hitting puberty hard, and at the time, my classmate Mckenna was the object of their gaze. But I had quite the crush on her brother Brendan, who was a couple of years older, athletic, and handsome. 

Telling Eisa that story made me feel so normal---two friends talking about a long-faded crush, not some shameful secret to be hidden. That moment with Eisa under the twinkly lights was the first step in a difficult journey towards seeing my queerness as good and beautiful.

I graduated from Stanford on cool summer day in June 2018. I remember waking up early, giving my boyfriend a kiss, getting dressed, parading in [Wacky Walk](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/08/wacky-walk/) to the stadium, and sitting down to watch the ceremony. Sterling K Brown, the claimed actor, [spoke to my class](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/06/17/2018-commencement-speech-stanford-alumnus-sterling-k-brown/) on life and loss, and love, reminding us to be not just "Bright like intelligent...But bright like LUMINOUS!". It was a proper send-off.

I met up with family afterward, celebrating, taking photos under those beautiful arches of the quad. They gave me a card full of their love and admiration and immense, overwhelming pride: sure, I had done a difficult, prestigious thing, but more importantly to them, I had stuck to who I was, with grace and integrity. The card still makes me tear up.

But throughout all of that celebration, there was the storm boiling in my life. I knew I had to tell them who I loved. 

I did it about 6 months later, two days after Christmas. I told them my story, from the beginning, with nothing left out. Plain and simple. It was the hardest conversation of my life.

Six months after coming out to my family, I found myself back in Stanford stadium with my parents, reunited in that place to celebrate the graduation of my sister Sophia's boyfriend. Funnily enough, my boyfriend was graduating from Stanford too, at the same time and in the same ceremony.  So Sophia and I sat with my parents, watching our boyfriends graduate.

The commencement speaker that day was Tim Cook, Apple CEO and one of the most prominent openly gay men in America. I remember one subtle reference to his sexuality, describing how he was an 8 year-old boy in Alabama during the Stonewall riots: "What I would not know, for a long time, was what I owed to a group of people I never knew in a place I'd never been." 

I remember feeling like my parents stiffen when he made that reference. Six months in, it was still too much to bear.

I was raised by two devout Catholics. A lot of my formative experiences in middle school and high school were in a church with a guitar in my hands, playing and singing worship songs to hundreds of people. 

My father was recently ordained as a Catholic Deacon, and he serves that same parish. At the ceremony I watched him make three sacred promises and then lie face down before an altar. His quiet, humble service of others, including the the sick, poor, and incarcerated is breathtaking. I'm proud of my parent's values, and I respect them so much---but their church teaches "homosexuality" as disordered and sinful, and progress, while [tangible](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/world/europe/pope-francis-same-sex-civil-unions.html), is slow.

My family is with me on this journey of self-acceptance, and I'm still learning to meet the homophobic parts of them (and myself) with empathy and love.

One day, years from now, I'll have my own children and I want to give them room to surprise me. Like my parents have, I'll try hard to be graceful in surprise, in disappointment even, but it won't be easy.

I'm blessed with four supportive siblings, who were confused and surprised, but have met this challenge with love and sincerity---finding guidance in their own communities and some newfound ones. Your support is everything---I love you Mark, Ellie, Sophia, and Carina.

Thank you to my co-staff in that freshman dorm, Eisa, Gia, Olivia, Jason, and Christian, and our resident fellows, Ari and Eva. You were there for me at an essential and indispensable part of my journey, and you constantly remind me that queer is beautiful.

Thank you Vincent, for being a patient, firm, and annoyingly honest friend. Thank you Michael, for pushing me in so many ways (including to write this!)

Thank you Kenji Yoshino for writing Covering, for capturing the beauty of queerness and fighting for it. And thank you to all of the queer people that came before me and fought for me, especially the trans POC.

Finally, thank you Edric, my love, my guy, my partner, for being true to me and true to yourself throughout these last few years, and pushing me to engage more deeply with who I am, and with my parents, even when it's hard. I love you so much, and I'm so thankful for what we have.

To anyone reading this, especially those that didn't know before: yes, I'm queer, but I'm also still me. In fact, I've been this way for a while. You can meet me with your confusion, your pain, and I will be there. 

Back in that freshman dorm, I remember learning a really important lesson from a member of my staff. They used the metaphor of a basket: we all have a basket we carry, filled with the things we don't get to take for granted, large and small, easy and painful.

Some people have a lot of different and heavy things in their basket, and it's our duty to remember that as we move through this world. To remember, as my mom says it: "there are no easy paths through life, but some paths are less easy than others". 

Queerness is the heaviest thing in my basket, alongside a stutter and a left leg that's too long. That's it. That's what's in my basket. I can carry it, especially with all the help that I get.

I want to spend the time I have helping others carry their baskets too and certainly not weighing them down with my judgment, my fear, my confusion, or my own pain that I'm still reconciling.
